0=Hi there! You must be the new magician! I hear you know how to levitate AND move objects. That is so cool! But I think moving objects is really neat also, would you like to learn how to transport objects too?
1=Are you ready to learn how to transport objects now?
2=Great! Right now my box is enchanted but it doesn't really do anything. Can you capture the spell onto your scroll? When you have captured it, open it up and look at it, then refer to your worksheet for an explanation.
3=Do you understand the spell now?
4=Ask your expert programmer for help, when you have understood the spell, let me know :D
5=Awesome! Now let's make this spell actually do something! Uncomment the line of code in the spell and then recast it onto my box.
6=Were you able to cast the spell?
7=Ask your expert programmer for help, when you have cast the spell, let me know :D
8=Did it do what you expected it to? Try changing around the parameters (the distance that it should move, the height it should levitate or the direction it should transport) and casting the box again.
9=Do you understand how the parameter changes how the box moves now?
10=Ask your expert programmer for help, when you have understood parameters, let me know :D
11=You are so incredible! That's all I have for you, now you can use the spells to do whatever you want with the boxes! Have fun!
12=That's all I have for you :)
