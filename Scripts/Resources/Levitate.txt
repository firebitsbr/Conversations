0=Hi there! Have you seen my box?
1=Oh! There it is! Someone must have used LEVITATE on it!!
2=LEVITATE is a spell used to make objects, like my box, float.
3=Yeah! Do you know what LEVITATE is?
4=Well fine then! Off you go!
5=Ugh. I don't want to talk to you anymore!
6=Well alright, I forgive you. Are you interested in learning what LEVITATE is?
7=Well, if only I could find my empty scroll I could show you...
8=No Problem! Would you like to learn how to use LEVITATE?
9=OK, come back when you want to learn how to use it.
10=Would you like to learn how to use LEVITATE now?
11=Have you found an empty scroll yet?
12=Great! Try dragging your empty scroll to the floating box. This will capture the LEVITATE spell onto your scroll.
13=Did you capture the LEVITATE spell onto your empty scroll?
14=Awesome! Now try viewing your LEVITATE spell by double clicking on the scroll that you captured the spell with.
15=OK, come back when you have captured the LEVITATE spell.
16=Were you able to view your LEVITATE spell?
17=Would you now like to learn how to cast your LEVITATE spell?
18=OK, come back when you have viewed your LEVITATE spell.
19=Just drag the LEVITATE scroll to an object to cast it. Try dragging it back to the box first.
20=OK, come back when you want to learn how to cast the LEVITATE spell.
21=Have you re-cast the box?
22=Awesome! Now, capture the LEVITATE spell onto your empty scroll again, then try casting the LEVITATE spell onto one of the trees.
23=OK, come back when you have re-cast the box.
24=Have you tried casting a tree?
25=OK, come back when you have tried casting the LEVITATE spell on a tree.
26=Did you get an error?
27=This error just means that the LEVITATE spell can only work on objects of a certain type: moveable. Since Trees aren't moveable, you cannot cast LEVITATE on them.
28=When a spell doesn't work as expected (or at all) that is called an error. 
29=That's great! That's all I have to teach you, now it's time for you to try levitating objects throughout the forest. Just make sure they are the right type of object!
30=Nothing left here!
31=It should be on the right of your screen.
