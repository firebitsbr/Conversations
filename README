The Conversation Project
************************

This project is for doing RPG-style conversations in Unity3D.  It is currently incomplete.

TODO:

1) Better subclassing of Conversation (See ExampleConversation for a step in the right direction).  
2) Prettier GUI for ConversationDisplayer.
3) NPCTalk should make the NPC turn toward the player when the conversation is initiated.
